# Notes
Started off by trying to dynamically create div elements that would represent each bar on the graph. The problem was how I would target each bar div in order to change it's color and the position of the text within it depending on the wants of the user.

May 18/2019 -- Decided to scrap the idea of creating the bar graph using divs after finding the following tutorial
about using the HTML <svg>/Scalable Vector Graphic element to create rectangles with JavaScript in order to achieve
the same effect.

# What I've Learned/Practiced By Doing This Project

- SVG elements
- JavaScript: setting element attributes, style, appending elements
- Jquery
