# Intro
This project is part of the Lighthouse Labs prep course leading up to their Web Development Bootcamp. I haven't signed up for the course, but found the materials online and decided to complete all the tasks in case I do end up doing the bootcamp and just for Javascript practice.

# Notes
My first approach was to dynamically create div elements that would represent each bar on the graph. The problem was I didn't know how I would target each bar div in order to change it's color and the position of the text within it depending on the wants of the user.

May 18/2019 -- Decided to scrap the idea of creating the bar graph using divs after finding the a tutorial
about using the HTML <svg>/Scalable Vector Graphic element to create rectangles with JavaScript in order to achieve
the same effect (see link no. 1 in the resources section).

# What I've Learned/Practiced By Doing This Project

- SVG elements - they're automatically inline!
- JavaScript: setting element attributes, style, appending elements
- Jquery syntax
- CSS

# To Dos
- fix the css: 
    - center all elements
    - fix the default colour of the bars and the text aka make it 'prettier'
